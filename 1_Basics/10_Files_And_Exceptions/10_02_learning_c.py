# 10-2. Learning C: You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a string with a different word. Here's a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:
# >>> message = "I really like dogs."
# >>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
# 'I really like cats.'
# Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print each modified line to the screen.

for line in content.splitlines():
    if line:
        print(line.replace("python", "C"))
